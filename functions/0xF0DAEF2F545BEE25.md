# PED::REQUEST_PEDHEADSHOT_IMG_UPLOAD

## Parameters
* **PEDHEADSHOT_ID** headshotId

## Returns
* **BOOL**: returns false if the request failed

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Upload a headshot texture to the cloud. IS_PEDHEADSHOT_IMG_UPLOAD_AVAILABLE
should be called first to ensure the upload feature is not already in use,
otherwise the request will fail.
The user must ensure that the headshot remains active during the upload process.
The upload is asynchronous so the user must query the status of the request
to know whether it's failed or succeeded.
The request must be explicitly released by the user by calling
RELEASE_PEDHEADSHOT_IMG_UPLOAD, regardless of whether the request failed
or succeeded; otherwise, no further requests will be processed.
