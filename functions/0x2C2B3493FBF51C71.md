# MISC::PAUSE_DEATH_ARREST_RESTART

## Summary
When the player is killed or arrested, he will be respawned at the closest hospital or police station.
If you want to give the player the option to replay a mission then call PAUSE_DEATH_ARREST_RESTART(TRUE) to prevent the respawn taking
place immediately. If the player chooses to replay the mission then call IGNORE_NEXT_RESTART(TRUE) and
call PAUSE_DEATH_ARREST_RESTART(FALSE). If the player chooses not to replay then just call PAUSE_DEATH_ARREST_RESTART(FALSE).
PAUSE_DEATH_ARREST_RESTART(TRUE) should only ever be called if you know that the player has been killed or arrested. Checking
IF NOT IS_PLAYER_PLAYING should be enough for this.

## Parameters
* **BOOL** paused
