## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Please keep all NATIVE definitions to a single line of code, to simplify some extra processing we need to do.

NOTE: ones that are -1, 0 - 35 are determined by a function where it gets a TextLabel from a global then runs,
GET_CHARACTER_FROM_AUDIO_CONVERSATION_FILENAME and depending on what the result is it goes in check order of 0 - 9 then A - Z then z (lowercase). So it will then return 0 - 35 or -1 if it's 'z'. The func to handle that ^^ is func_67 in dialog_handler.c atleast in TU27 Xbox360 scripts.

p0 is -1, 0 - 35
p1 is a char or string (whatever you wanna call it)
p2 is Global 10597 + i * 6. 'i' is a while(i < 70) loop
p3 is again -1, 0 - 35 
p4 is again -1, 0 - 35 
p5 is either 0 or 1 (bool ?)
p6 is either 0 or 1 (The func to determine this is bool)
p7 is either 0 or 1 (The func to determine this is bool)
p8 is either 0 or 1 (The func to determine this is bool)
p9 is 0 - 3 (Determined by func_60 in dialogue_handler.c)
p10 is either 0 or 1 (The func to determine this is bool)
p11 is either 0 or 1 (The func to determine this is bool)
p12 is unknown as in TU27 X360 scripts it only goes to p11.
