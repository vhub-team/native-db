Full list of ped scenarios by DurtyFree: https://github.com/DurtyFree/gta-v-data-dumps/blob/master/scenariosCompact.json

Also a few more listed at TASK::TASK_START_SCENARIO_IN_PLACE just above.
---------------
The first parameter in every scenario has always been a Ped of some sort. The second like TASK_START_SCENARIO_IN_PLACE is the name of the scenario. 

The next 4 parameters were harder to decipher. After viewing "hairdo_shop_mp.ysc.c4", and being confused from seeing the case in other scripts, they passed the first three of the arguments as one array from a function, and it looked like it was obviously x, y, and z.

I haven't seen the sixth parameter go to or over 360, making me believe that it is rotation, but I really can't confirm anything.

I have no idea what the last 3 parameters are, but I'll try to find out.

-going on the last 3 parameters, they appear to always be "0, 0, 1"

p6 -1 also used in scrips

p7 used for sitting scenarios

p8 teleports ped to position
