The specified ped will need to be in position prior to calling this task, otherwise he/she will be warped

Attaches a ped to a rope and allows player control to rappel down a wall. Disables all collisions while on the rope.
p10: Usually 1 in the scripts, clipSet: Clipset to use for the task, minZ: Minimum Z that the player can descend to, ropeHandle: Rope to attach this task to created with ADD_ROPE
