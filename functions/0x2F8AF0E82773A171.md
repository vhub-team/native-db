## Parameters
* **PED_INDEX** ped
* **PED_INDEX** otherPed
* **VEHICLE_INDEX** targetVehicle: ID is of type VEHICLE_INDEX
* **FLOAT** coorsX
* **FLOAT** coorsY
* **FLOAT** coorsZ
* **FLOAT** abortRange: Float is the distance in metres from the target at which the task will be aborted.
* **INT** frequencyPercentage: Should be between 0 (never shoot) and 100 (fire as fast as possible).

If this is set it will allow the ped to continue driving whilst shooting.

Example:

TASK::TASK_DRIVE_BY(l_467[1/*22*/], PLAYER::PLAYER_PED_ID(), 0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.0, 300.0, 100, 0, ${firing_pattern_burst_fire_driveby});




Needs working example. Doesn't seem to do anything.

I marked p2 as targetVehicle as all these shooting related tasks seem to have that in common.
I marked p6 as distanceToShoot as if you think of GTA's Logic with the native SET_VEHICLE_SHOOT natives, it won't shoot till it gets within a certain distance of the target.
I marked p7 as pedAccuracy as it seems it's mostly 100 (Completely Accurate), 75, 90, etc. Although this could be the ammo count within the gun, but I highly doubt it. I will change this comment once I find out if it's ammo count or not.
