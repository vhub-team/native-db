# HUD::THEFEED_AUTO_POST_GAMETIPS_OFF

## Summary
Turns random game tips off.
THEFEED_FORCE_RENDER_OFF() may need to be called depending on
where this needs to be displayed.

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Displays "normal" notifications again after calling `THEFEED_AUTO_POST_GAMETIPS_ON` (those that were drawn before calling this native too), though those will have a weird offset and stay on screen forever (tested with notifications created from same script).
