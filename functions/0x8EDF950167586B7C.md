## Parameters
* **INT** nodeId: This must be unique for each patrol route.
* **STRING** nodeType:

Set this to zero to make the ped look at nothing.
* **FLOAT** nodePositionX
* **FLOAT** nodePositionY
* **FLOAT** nodePositionZ
* **FLOAT** nodeLookAtPosX

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Adds a patrol route node. Moreinfo..
This can only be called once OPEN_PATROL_ROUTE has been called.
There cane be a maximum of 16 nodes per route.

Example: 
TASK::ADD_PATROL_ROUTE_NODE(2, "WORLD_HUMAN_GUARD_STAND", -193.4915, -2378.864990234375, 10.9719, -193.4915, -2378.864990234375, 10.9719, 3000);

p0 is between 0 and 4 in the scripts.

p1 is "WORLD_HUMAN_GUARD_STAND" or "StandGuard".

p2, p3 and p4 is only one parameter sometimes in the scripts. Most likely a Vector3 hence p2, p3 and p4 are coordinates. 
Examples: 
TASK::ADD_PATROL_ROUTE_NODE(1, "WORLD_HUMAN_GUARD_STAND", l_739[7/*3*/], 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0);

TASK::ADD_PATROL_ROUTE_NODE(1, "WORLD_HUMAN_GUARD_STAND", l_B0[17/*44*/]._f3, l_B0[17/*44*/]._f3, 2000);

p5, p6 and p7 are for example set to: 1599.0406494140625, 2713.392578125, 44.4309.

p8 is an int, often random set to for example: MISC::GET_RANDOM_INT_IN_RANGE(5000, 10000).
