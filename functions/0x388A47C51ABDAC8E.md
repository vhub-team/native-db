## Parameters
* **PLAYER_INDEX** player: Is no longer allowed to break out of the busted task
* **BOOL** checkBustedTask = true: If this is set to FALSE then we'll only rely on the player's game state, which is set to arrested

## Returns
* **BOOL**

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Return true while player is being arrested / busted.
