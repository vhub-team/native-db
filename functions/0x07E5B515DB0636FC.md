# CAM::RENDER_SCRIPT_CAMS

## Summary
Tells the game that the script wants to enable or disable rendering of scripted cameras

## Parameters
* **BOOL** setActive
* **BOOL** doGameCamInterp: If true, the rendering change is implemented as an interpolation.
* **INT** duration = 3000: Specifies the duration of any interpolation.
* **BOOL** shouldLockInterpolationSourceFrame = true: If false, the source frame is updated throughout the interpolation, allowing for fully dynamic interpolation that can reduce the appearance of 'lag' when the source frame is not static.
* **BOOL** shouldApplyAcrossAllThreads = false:
If true, a request to stop rendering will be enforced irrespective of whether other script threads expect rendering to be active.
Note that this can result in conflicts between concurrent script threads, so this must be used with caution.
* **RENDERING_OPTION_FLAGS** renderingOptions = 0

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
The script must have created a camera that can be rendered. Note that rendering is typically not stopped if another script thread still expects it to be active (see bShouldApplyAcrossAllThreads.)

ease - smooth transition between the camera's positions
easeTime - Time in milliseconds for the transition to happen

If you have created a script (rendering) camera, and want to go back to the 
character (gameplay) camera, call this native with render set to 0.
Setting ease to 1 will smooth the transition.
