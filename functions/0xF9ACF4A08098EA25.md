# PED::SPECIAL_FUNCTION_DO_NOT_USE

## Parameters
* **PED_INDEX** ped
* **BOOL** noCollisionUntilClear = true

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
This fn is only to be used in very specific situations where the ped needs to be inside the car still but not attached
Only use if you've chatted to Chi-Wai or Ben L.

p1 was always 1 (true).

Kicks the ped from the current vehicle and keeps the rendering-focus on this ped (also disables its collision). If doing this for your player ped, you'll still be able to drive the vehicle.
