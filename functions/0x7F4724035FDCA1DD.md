# PAD::ALLOW_ALTERNATIVE_SCRIPT_CONTROLS_LAYOUT

## Summary
Switches INPUT_SCRIPT_controls to use alternative layouts

## Parameters
* **CONTROL_TYPE** control

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
This must be called every frame or else the controls revert back to defaults. The INPUT_SCRIPT_controls mimic a PS3/Xbox
gamepad, however, the user may change the control layout in the settings. Some mission/script might need to know this.
For example, if the INPUT_SCRIPT_controls are being used to control movement and the camera, then the script need to know
if the player has selected Southpaw (sticks are swapped) mode. Calling ALLOW_ALTERNATIVE_SCRIPT_CONTROLS_LAYOUT() every frame
will calculate this for you so you can carry on using the INPUT_SCRIPT_controls as if they were the standard layout when infact
they are actually altered to reflect the user preferences.
Some scripts/mission will *NOTwant this, for example, Yoga asks the user to move specific sticks. In this case, not calling
ALLOW_ALTERNATIVE_SCRIPT_CONTROLS_LAYOUT() will default to use the standard gamepad layout no matter what the user has set their
settings to.
