From what I can tell it looks like it does the following:
Creates/hosts a new transition to another online session, using this in FiveM will result in other players being disconencted from the server/preventing them from joining. This is most likely because I entered the wrong session parameters since they're pretty much all unknown right now.
You also need to use `NetworkJoinTransition(Player player)` and `NetworkLaunchTransition()`.
