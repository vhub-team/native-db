## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
This command can be used to temporarily disable the player’s controls. The controls should be switched back on again as soon as possible.
NOTE Turning this on will make vehicles proof from bullets etc. Likewise when the player controls are turned back on it will make ALL the vehicles vunerable again,
so you will have to set them back with SET_CAR_CAN_BE_DAMAGED(vehicle_name, FALSE).

SPC_AMBIENT_SCRIPT = (1 << 1),
