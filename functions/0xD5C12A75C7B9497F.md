## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
NOTE: To take the coordinates of a cover point you'd like to create, do the following:
Stand behind the object you'd like to take cover behind.
Face towards the object you're standing behind.
If you do it this way then the following is true:
The heading that is output to your temp_debug.txt is the 'FLOAT direction'
Another thing to bear in mind is:
When setting COVERPOINT_USAGE, COVUSE_WALLTOLEFT will flip the ped out to his right hand side, and so COVUSE_WALLTORIGHT will flip the ped out to his left.
