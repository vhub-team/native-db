<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Example from fm_mission_controler.ysc.c4:

PLAYER::SET_PLAYER_LOCKON(PLAYER::PLAYER_ID(), 1);

All other decompiled scripts using this seem to be using the player id as the first parameter, so I feel the need to confirm it as so.

No need to confirm it says PLAYER_ID() so it uses PLAYER_ID() lol.
