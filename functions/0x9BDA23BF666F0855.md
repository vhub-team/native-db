# VEHICLE::SET_VEHICLE_COUNTERMEASURE_AMMO

## Parameters
* **VEHICLE_INDEX** vehicle
* **INT** ammoCount: Must be positive (0 or greater).

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Sets the current countermeasure ammo count for a script vehicle.
Unlike restricted vehicle ammo (which is code fired), this is script-fired and manually decremented, and only stored in vehicle code for network sync purposes.

Similar to SET_VEHICLE_BOMB_AMMO, this sets the amount of countermeasures that are present on this vehicle.
Use GET_VEHICLE_BOMB_AMMO to get the current amount.
