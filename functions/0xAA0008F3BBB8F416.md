# GRAPHICS::SET_DRAW_ORIGIN

## Summary
Call this with a 3d point in the world so that all subsequent sprites and text are relative to the screen coordinates for that point

## Parameters
* **FLOAT** vecOriginX
* **FLOAT** vecOriginY
* **FLOAT** vecOriginZ
* **BOOL** is2d = false

## Description
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Sets the on-screen drawing origin for draw-functions (which is normally x=0,y=0 in the upper left corner of the screen) to a world coordinate.
From now on, the screen coordinate which displays the given world coordinate on the screen is seen as x=0,y=0.

Example in C#:
Vector3 boneCoord = somePed.GetBoneCoord(Bone.SKEL_Head);
Function.Call(Hash.SET_DRAW_ORIGIN, boneCoord.X, boneCoord.Y, boneCoord.Z, 0);
Function.Call(Hash.DRAW_SPRITE, "helicopterhud", "hud_corner", -0.01, -0.015, 0.013, 0.013, 0.0, 255, 0, 0, 200);
Function.Call(Hash.DRAW_SPRITE, "helicopterhud", "hud_corner", 0.01, -0.015, 0.013, 0.013, 90.0, 255, 0, 0, 200);
Function.Call(Hash.DRAW_SPRITE, "helicopterhud", "hud_corner", -0.01, 0.015, 0.013, 0.013, 270.0, 255, 0, 0, 200);
Function.Call(Hash.DRAW_SPRITE, "helicopterhud", "hud_corner", 0.01, 0.015, 0.013, 0.013, 180.0, 255, 0, 0, 200);
Function.Call(Hash.CLEAR_DRAW_ORIGIN);

If the pedestrian starts walking around now, the sprites are always around her head, no matter where the head is displayed on the screen.

This function also effects the drawing of texts and other UI-elements.
The effect can be reset by calling GRAPHICS::CLEAR_DRAW_ORIGIN().
